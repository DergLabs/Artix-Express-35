# FPGA-PCIE-Card

**Current Revision: 3**

This is a base design for an Artix-7 35T based FPGA card with PCIE and USB interface. This is meant as an open source, DIY alternative to commercial PCIE FPGA development cards and to be a learning experience for me in high speed complex FPGA design.

Altium Designer files are to come along with PCB designs in the future. 

Consider this project in its pre-Alpha stage with **ZERO testing and verification.** 
This whole design has been based on reference designs/guidance from Diligent, Xilinx, and FTDI.

This design is fully open source and free for anyone to use, copy, or whatever else you'd like.
